        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shawarma is the delectable middle-eastern method of preparing various meats, in this case, chicken. Traditionally, shawarma meat is slowly cooked on a vertical rotating rotisserie spit which produces heavenly bits of fatty, moist meat. In this recipe, we will instead be pan-grilling the chicken, making it easier to prepare at home and still tasting fantastic!</p>
        <p>Chicken shawarma can be enjoyed in various ways, such as: on a salad, over fries, on its own, or as we'll be doing in this recipe, stuffed in a tasty wrap!</p>
